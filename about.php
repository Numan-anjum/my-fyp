  <p><b> Introduction:</b><br><br>
  
Mingle Box is a marketplace where Clients who need custom software developed can find coders in a
safe and business-friendly environment. Clients can pick from a pool of registered coders, enabling
them to hire a coder across the country or across the globe from the comfort of their computers.
Coders and Clients both can be benefited from this hiring. Clients who wish to hire internationally,
can take advantage of favorable overseas exchange rates, resulting in work being done for 50-90%
less than if the project were done in-country.
Coders are also given access to a huge pool of potential work and have the ability to work
independently from their homes rather than for a company. </p>
